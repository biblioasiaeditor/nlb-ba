The Bandstand is one of the oldest landmarks in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, and was used for military band performances for many years. It remains a perennial favourite photo spot for wedding couples due to the many majestic rain trees <i>(Samanea saman)</i> surrounding it. <i>Courtesy of the Singapore Botanic Gardens</i>.

The Singapore Botanic Gardens is the oldest public garden in Singapore. Established in 1859, it is one of the region’s top centres for plant and biodiversity research, apart from being a popular recreational attraction. On 4 July 2015, the 74-hectare Botanic Gardens was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, scoring a first for Singapore. Interestingly, the gardens is one of only three in the world that enjoy World Heritage Site status, the others being the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, England, and the Orto Botanico in Padua, Italy.

The present Botanic Gardens was founded by the Singapore Agri-Horticultural Society in 1859. Lawrence Niven was recruited as its first superintendent (1859–75).
